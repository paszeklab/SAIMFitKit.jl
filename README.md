Julia implementation of the Scanning Angle Interference Microscopy (SAIM) fitting algorithms

## Description
Fitting algorithm reconstructs sample height from a stack of scanning angle interference images. The julia project is an alpha release and does not yet contain all features and optimizations in our C++ package. More details on the fiting algorithms can be found in the following papers:
